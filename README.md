# dot_files
This repository contains my configuration files for i3 (my window-manager) and vim (my prefered text-editor) 
and tmux (my prefered terminal multiplexer).
To use them simply execute the install script which will then create the needed symlinks.

Note: I'm using Vundle as my plugin-manager for vim so you will need that aswell.
  Check out https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim for an installation guide.
  You may also have to tweak the i3 config when using a laptop (in case the i3-bar does not display the battery status correctly)
  and change the font (given you don't have it installed)
