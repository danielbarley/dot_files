# dot_files
This repository contains my configuration files for i3 (my window-manager) and vim (my prefered text-editor).
To use them just clone the files to your home directory.

Note: I'm using Vundle as my plugin-manager for vim so you will need that aswell 
  check out https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim for an installation guide.
  Also you may have to tweak the i3 config when using a laptop in case the i3-bar does not display the battery status correctly
